In my sophomore year of college, I developed a database application for an airline ticketing system. I used MySQL to manage the database, and the UI was built using the Qt C++ framework. The application offers several key features for users, including:

- Extensive search functionality for finding flights between two destinations
- Seat reservation on a flight
- Reservation cancellation
- Passenger search by ID
- Reservation modification
- Status reporting

The application features a clean, minimalist user interface with a grey and red color scheme.
