I lived in Pondicherry, India, from 2013 to 2023. Pondicherry is a charming, laid-back town in southern India that was a French colonial settlement until 1954. The French influence is still evident today, with its French Quarter, colonial villas, and chic boutiques. While studying computer science in high school there, I decided to create an endless runner game, featuring characters based on myself and my friends, with obstacles like an autorickshaw (driven by me) and black house crows, all set against a backdrop of Pondicherry.

To develop the game, I used a programming language called Processing, which is often used for prototyping Android applications. I created all the illustrations using Affinity Designer, drawing inspiration from actual photos of the town and its landmarks. After integrating the illustrations with the game logic and designing a clean, simple user interface, I exported the project as an Android APK file, which can be installed on Android devices.
