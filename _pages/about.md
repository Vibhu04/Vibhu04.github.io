I'm currently doing a remote researchs internship at DREAM Lab run by Dr. Haohan Wang at University of Illinois Urbana-CHampaign, and at Dr. Min Xu's Lab ats Carnegie Mellon University. Previously I worked as a machine learning and softare engineering intern at Telekinesis AI, a robotics and AI startup based at TU Darmstadt. I graduated from the Sri Aurobindo International Centre of Education with a B.Sc. in Mathematics and Computer Science.

<!-- I’m a Masters student at Centrale Nantes studying Advanced Robotics. I work as a research assistant at Lab-V2 run by Dr. Paulo Shakarian at Arizona State University and at ARLIS at the University of Maryland. Previously I interned in Dr. Min Xu’s Lab at Carnegie Mellon University. I was very fortunate to be one of the early members of Telekinesis, a robotics and AI startup based at TU Darmstadt. I graduated from the Sri Aurobindo International Centre of Education with a B.Sc. in Computer Science, Math and Physics.
