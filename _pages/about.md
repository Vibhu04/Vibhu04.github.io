### About me <br>

I am currently pursuing a Master’s degree in Applied Mathematics at Université Paris Cité, where I was awarded a full scholarship. I've previously gained research and industry experience in the fields of machine learning, computer vision, and technical analysis. Most recently, I worked remotely as a Machine Learning Engineer at Neptune Technologies LLC, a fintech company based in Florida, USA. Prior to that, I did remote research internships at DREAM Lab, run by Dr. Haohan Wang at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, and at Dr. Min Xu's lab at Carnegie Mellon University. I also interned at Telekinesis AI, a robotics and AI startup at TU Darmstadt. I graduated from the Sri Aurobindo International Centre of Education with a B.Sc. in Mathematics and Computer Science.


<!-- I’m a Masters student at Centrale Nantes studying Advanced Robotics. I work as a research assistant at Lab-V2 run by Dr. Paulo Shakarian at Arizona State University and at ARLIS at the University of Maryland. Previously I interned in Dr. Min Xu’s Lab at Carnegie Mellon University. I was very fortunate to be one of the early members of Telekinesis, a robotics and AI startup based at TU Darmstadt. I graduated from the Sri Aurobindo International Centre of Education with a B.Sc. in Computer Science, Math and Physics.

Vib. Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](https://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You casn also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
